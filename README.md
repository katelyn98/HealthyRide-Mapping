# HealthyRide Mapping

This repository consists of several visualizations used to analyze and evaluate Pittsburgh's HealthyRide Bike Sharing Program. The datasets used can be found in the `data` folder. Code for the visualizations created can be found in the `Notebooks` folder. Images of all visualizations I created can be found in the `Results` folder.
